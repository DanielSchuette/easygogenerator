# An Easy Way to Generate Static Websites from Templates
`easygogenerator` is an easy-to-use website generator. I built it to make my life easier whenever I update my GitHub Pages project website. I have multiple content pages that all have a common header and footer. I don't want to change every single one of those pages when I make a change to the header or footer, though. Instead, I just `easygogenerator` to create complete html files with header and footer with one command. If that sounds like something you might need, continue reading!


## Overview
`easygogenerator` takes a `header.html`, a `footer.html` (optional) and an arbitrary number of html files as its input. It then creates new html pages as follows:

```
header.html

<!-- start content -->

content.html

<!-- end content -->

footer.html
```
